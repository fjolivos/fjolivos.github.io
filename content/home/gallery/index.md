One of my passions is traveling. Getting lost and exploring the unexplored always are fascinating. Through photography, I can capture those moments, store them and recall them time-to-time. At the same time, it helps me to overcome one of my frustrations... arts. I can't sing without being out of tone. Although I try and it is in my blood, I am not a good dancer either; painting? sculpture? perish the thought! But photography is body-independent, it just needs scenes and the best of my creativity.
