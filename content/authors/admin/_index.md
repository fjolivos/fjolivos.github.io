I’m a sociological wanderer. I’m proud of saying that I have studied in three cultures. They define not only what I am as a researcher, but also as a person.  In Chile I discovered the passion for what I am doing and I got a strong background on quantitative methods. In the Netherlands I understood the relevance of the theory for social research and methods theoretically driven as the way for doing high impact research. Today, my intellectual, social and cultural environment is Hong Kong, where Western and Eastern scholastic traditions meet. The credibility of quantitative analyses is the new ingredient as well as the ambition to produce cutting-edge knowledge.
