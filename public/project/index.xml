      <title>Uncovering the Heterogeneity of Cultural Capital Effect on Cognitive Skills using Tree-Based Machine Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Human and cultural capital approaches are suggested as two explanations of educational achievement. The first approach maintains that certain cognitive abilities or technical skills are the most important determinants of success in the educational system. In the cultural capital approach, students&amp;rsquo; outcomes are mainly affected by a set of subtle cultural conventions. However, scholars argue that cognitive performance is also one of the pathways linking cultural capital and school success (Breinholt and J?ger 2020; Hu and Wu 2019). Different cultural capital dimensions foster the development of cognitive skills and abilities, having crucial consequences throughout the life course. Thus, the analytical distinction between cultural capital and cognitive skills, and their relationship, are of primary importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the relationship between cultural capital and cognitive skills has been studied for Western countries (e.g., Coulangeon, 2018; Graaf, Graaf, &amp;amp; Kraaykamp, 2000; Kisida, Greene, &amp;amp; Bowen, 2014), it has been less examined in China&amp;rsquo;s case (an exception is Hu &amp;amp; Wu, 2019). Previous studies in other East Asian countries -characterized by exam-oriented educational systems where performance depends heavily on the mastery of basic subjects- suggest that cultural capital operates primarily by enhancing students&amp;rsquo; cognitive skills (Yamamoto and Brinton 2010). We contribute to this literature by discussing whether the effect of cultural capital on cognitive skills may depend on the school context and resources. Students bring unequal degrees of cultural capital to school, where differences are amplified or ameliorated by school characteristics (Marteleto and Andrade 2014). Thus, empirical evidence has suggested that school resources are important for converting cultural capital into educational achievement. School resources could include facilities, teachers&amp;rsquo; training, class size, school socioeconomic composition, and student-teacher ratio, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proposed article applies a novel computational method to address this sociological question in Chinese society: Tree-based machine learning. Causal trees are a data-driven computational method to explore sources of effect heterogeneity. Although machine learning (ML) tools have &amp;ldquo;yet to have its watershed moment within sociology&amp;rdquo; (Edelmann et al. 2020:73), they could provide solutions to long-standing sociological problems (Molina and Garip 2019). &amp;ldquo;Causal trees&amp;rdquo; are a specific ML method (Athey and Imbens 2016; Brand et al., forthcoming) to uncover population heterogeneity in observational data and more transparently depict the analyses that lead to a focus on particular subgroups (Brand et al., forthcoming). This method enables us to identify sources of variation that sociologists may not have previously considered or envisaged. To illustrate the causal tree algorithm&amp;rsquo;s sociological utility, we examine how school context shapes the cultural capital effect on cognitive skills in China. Besides the methodological contribution, the study addresses two substantive research questions: Does cultural capital increases students&amp;rsquo; cognitive skills? Does the effect of cultural capital on cognitive skills vary by school resources?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis will proceed as follows. First, we will report descriptive statistics of the key explanatory variables and covariates. Second, we will estimate the average effect of cultural capital on cognitive skills using covariate balancing propensity score for a continuous treatment (Fong, Hazlett, and Imai 2018). Third, we will examine the heterogeneous effects of cultural capital on cognitive skills for defined subgroups using CBPS and causal forest. In the CBPS, theoretically motivated covariates affecting both cultural capital and cognitive development. Fourth, we will assess the heterogeneous effects for subgroups identified by the selected causal tree. Although the literature suggests the relevance of school-level variables, we do not which particular characteristics or resources interact substantively with cultural capital. Finally, the sensitivity of partition-specific effect estimates to unobserved confounding will be evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To study our questions, we will use the China Educational Panel Survey (CEPS). It is a unique longitudinal dataset that provides a rich set of cultural capital measurements in tandem with a cognitive skills test for a representative sample of middle-school students surveyed in 7th and 8th grades. We propose a 9-item Cultural Capital Index using an IRT GRM model to capture cultural capital as a latent variable. It combines three important dimensions suggested by previous studies (J?ger and Karlson 2018): familiarity with the legitimate culture, reading behavior, and extracurricular activities. In CEPS, cognitive skills are measured based on a test assessing students&amp;rsquo; aptitudes over 22 items on reasoning and problem-solving (Zhao et al. 2017). The test is unrelated to the school curriculum. To facilitate the comparability across students, scores were estimated using an item response theory model and z-scores. For assessing the heterogeneity of the cultural capital effect, a large set of theoretically relevant indicators of school quality and resources will be included.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following studies on the revival of emotions in the cultural analysis of social movements (Berezin, 2002; Goodwin, Jasper, &amp;amp; Polletta, 2000; Jasper, 1998, 2011, 2014;), these emotions have been isolated as causal mechanisms of willingness or actual engagement in social movements (eg. DeCelles, Sonenshein, &amp;amp; King, 2019; Thomas, Zubielevitch, Sibley, &amp;amp; Osborne, 2020; Weber, Mummendey, &amp;amp; Waldzus, 2002). In addition, they are also crucial for the effectiveness of movements as well as for generating potential long-term transformations. Although less studied, the emotional response of the general population to social movements is highly significant in the current context, where climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, and widespread socio-political crises have given rise to uncertainties about the future directions of our value systems and traditional forms of culture. What effect do these events, as moral shocks, have on the way we think and feel? &lt;strong&gt;In this study, we attempt to examine the short-term effects of one of these shocks on affections toward citizens (reciprocal moral emotions) and sentiments toward the country (shared moral emotions)&lt;/strong&gt; (Jasper, 1998, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotions are an aspect of culture&lt;/strong&gt;. Culture delineates how emotions are constituted, managed, and experienced (Thoits, 1989). Emotions are shared among individuals and are socially influenced (Jasper, 2011, 2014). They are also part of the public culture as collective feelings (Berezin, 2002), and individuals can strategically use them to make sense of their actions (Swidler, 2001). Therefore, how individuals change their emotions toward certain objects is a question of cultural change. Using an interrupted public opinion poll, we analyze the impact of the first weeks of the 2019 “Chilean spring” (Somma, Bargsted, Disi Pavlic, &amp;amp; Medel, 2020) on the country’s sense of pride, economic development, and Chilean citizens themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chilean social outburst  is one case within a multicausal global wave of protests. Hong Kong, Lebanon, Catalonia, and, more recently, the United States have witnessed massive social movements.  Discussing whether these movements are connected goes beyond the aims of this study, but we can affirm they are part of a widespread crisis of political institutions across the globe. The “Chilean spring” provides an opportunity to evaluate the changes in emotions of the general population after the first weeks of protest activities in one of these movements, which we refer to as the short-term consequences of the social movement. &lt;strong&gt;The case of the protests in Chile is significant because it was the first country to implement neo-liberal economic policies&lt;/strong&gt; (Harvey, 2007), and this movement has highlighted the deficiencies of the model. Therefore, not only do the protests in Chile defy the country’s structural conditions, but also the legitimacy of the global economic system. As Fantasia and Hirsch (2004) argue, acute social struggles provide the bases for cultural transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chilean social outburst initiated what cultural sociologists (Bail, 2012; Swidler, 1986) have called “unsettled times,”&lt;/strong&gt; where the unprecedented, large-scale crisis challenges shared beliefs about how society should work and about the emotions people feel towards the social environment. As “moral holidays” (Ray, 2014), in these contexts collective feelings and worldviews could be redefined or resignified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early October 2019, secondary-school students initiated the practice of fare dodging on the subway in Santiago, the capital of Chile, as a protest against the increase in the fare from about USD 1.12 to USD 1.16, equivalent to 0.28 percent of the minimum wage (Gonzalez &amp;amp; Morán, 2020). Protests involving students have been commonplace in Chile’s political landscape, reaching one of its most critical moments with the so-called “penguin revolution” in 2006 (Donoso, 2013; Guzman-Concha, 2012). However, on October 18, protests escalated to the general population.  Barricades were built, the entire subway system was shut down after attacks, and stations were set alight. On October 19, protests continued across the country with shops being looted, buses burned, and clashes between protestors and special police forces. The government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew. Several international organizations have reported human rights violations during that time (eg. United Nations, 2019). Although the protests have been sporadic during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the entire spectrum of political parties has approved a referendum for a new political constitution, the case of Hong Kong (Wang, Ramzy, &amp;amp; May, 2020) suggests that the Chilean movement could also be resumed once the health emergency is under control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a shared feature of unsettled times and turning points (Abbott, 1997; Bail, 2012), social scientists and policymakers claim that the escalation of the events in Chile on October 18 was unexpected or “they did not see it coming” (eg. Sanhueza, 2019; Somma et al., 2020). However, its underlying causes are still a matter of debate. The low levels of political identification, distrust in political parties, unfulfilled expectations, cultural change, and market-based inequalities, among others, have been suggested (eg. Gonzalez &amp;amp; Morán, 2020; Somma et al., 2020). These structural conditions, in tandem with emotions, are a common ground for population’s violent actions (Ray, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite citizens’ demands for deep structural reforms (eg. changes in the pension system, reform of the police, a new political constitution), Chile has been long considered one of the most developed countries in Latin America. In the last three decades, Chile has undergone unprecedented changes: poverty reduction, increased GDP, and longer life expectancy (The World Bank, 2017). &lt;strong&gt;Hence, this article compares moral emotions before and after the unexpected events of the first weeks of the Chilean protest movement&lt;/strong&gt;. Coincidentally, the social crisis interrupted the fieldwork of a public opinion survey designed to measure beliefs and attitudes toward the country (Fundación Imagen de Chile, 2019). This survey provides, then, a unique opportunity to examine the effects of the first weeks of the “Chilean spring” as a moral shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the literature on emotions and social movements, &lt;strong&gt;the Chilean social outburst could be conceptualized as a moral shock (Jasper, 1998, 2011, 2014) that provided information signaling that the country was not as successful as assumed by the citizens&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to the re-articulation of emotions toward the country and citizens themselves. Our findings indicate that the protests negatively affected pride in the country, in official symbols, in economic development, and in Chile as a place to live. Nevertheless, the valorization of characteristics of Chileans was positively affected by the social outburst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contribution to the literature is threefold. &lt;strong&gt;First, this study is one of the first to provide robust evidence of the consequences of the “Chilean spring,”&lt;/strong&gt; which is part of a larger and dynamic ongoing wave of protests in the world. Second, in recent decades, the literature on emotions has taught us much about why people protest (Stekelenburg &amp;amp; Klandermans, 2013; Ray, 2014). However, &lt;strong&gt;there are few studies considering its cultural impacts on citizens&lt;/strong&gt;. Third, social and political psychologists have provided evidence of the role of emotions using lab experiments. Despite their internal validity, these studies lack ecological validity (Stekelenburg &amp;amp; Klandermans, 2013), and researchers are unsure as to whether the students in the lab are willing to take to the streets. &lt;strong&gt;Besides defining emotions as an outcome, we use a public opinion survey applied to the general population before and after the outburst of protests&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, our findings are grounded in more realistic settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural omnivorousness and status inconsistency in Chile</title>
      <link>/project/consumption/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sociological research has long shown that cultural participation is socially stratified (Bourdieu, 1979; Chan &amp;amp; Goldthorpe, 2007a; Lizardo, 2019; Peterson, 1992). Groups higher up in the social hierarchy differ from middle and low-status groups in the cultural activities they engage in, and how they combine diverse cultural practices. Moreover, social stratification is multidimensional (Grusky &amp;amp; Ku, 2008), and social hierarchies may be defined by an array of factors, such as income, education, power, or occupation. In recent decades, many of these factors have been examined in the literature on cultural sociology and social stratification (e.g. Friedman &amp;amp; Reeves, 2020; Lamont, 1992; Warde, Wright, &amp;amp; Gayo-Cal, 2007). Nevertheless, standard measurements might not reflect the complexity of socioeconomic status (Andersson, 2015). Thus, subjective social status has emerged as an alternative for uncovering facets of unobserved socioeconomic status. Through self-placement, cognizant agents make sense of their own past, present, and future socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. Nielsen, Roos, &amp;amp; Combs, 2015). Primarily in social epidemiology, studies have shown that subjective positioning explains individual outcomes that cannot be accounted for by objective measurements (e.g. Demakakos, Nazroo, Breeze, &amp;amp; Marmot, 2008). &lt;strong&gt;In this study, we extend the research on subjective dimensions of stratification by examining the relationship between subjective and objective social status (hereafter SSS and OSS, respectively) and social distinction practices through cultural consumption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, &lt;strong&gt;we focus on what the tradition in cultural sociology terms the cultural omnivore&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., Chan &amp;amp; Goldthorpe, 2007a; Peterson &amp;amp; Kern, 1996). That is, individuals in advantaged social positions are more likely to consume highbrow culture, but without aversion for lowbrow cultural practices, thus engaging in more eclectic cultural consumption. Besides the effect of SSS on individual outcomes, even after controlling for traditional measures of socioeconomic status, researchers have shown that SSS and OSS often do not coincide (Kelley &amp;amp; Evans, 2017). This inconsistency has important effects on individuals’ outcomes, such as health status and political behavior (e.g., Jackman &amp;amp; Jackman, 1973; Jin, Tam, &amp;amp; Tao, 2019). The theoretical significance of examining inconsistency lies in its puzzling implications for cultural consumption. Despite the evidence supporting a positive relationship between measurements of status and cultural omnivorousness, status inconsistency is a common situation, where actors also receive and develop inconsistent expectations of group boundaries. Therefore, this framework raises important questions about the behavioral implications of status inconsistency. Do individuals who overestimate their position in the social hierarchy differ from those who are objectively located in that position? Do individuals balance or combine subjective and objective social positions? How do these dimensions of social stratification relate to omnivorousness when they are inconsistent? &lt;strong&gt;Furthermore, in addition to examining whether subjective social position affects cultural stratification, we aim to understand the implications of inconsistent objective and subjective social positioning for cultural consumption&lt;/strong&gt;. For the sake of simplicity, we use cultural consumption and participation as exchangeable terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We develop arguments regarding dominance of OSS or SSS, and the combination of both dimensions of stratification in the explanation of the cultural omnivore. Regarding specific scenarios of inconsistency, namely status-overestimating and status-underestimating actors, a balancing mechanism is tested against the predominance of one of the two resources across types of inconsistency. Moreover, the empirical literature on status inconsistency has suffered from methodological and conceptual shortcomings (Zhao et al., 2018). Following recent studies (Chan &amp;amp; Turner, 2017; Jin et al., 2019), as explained in the analytical strategy section, &lt;strong&gt;we seek to overcome these limitations by using multinomial diagonal reference models (DRM)&lt;/strong&gt;. In a nutshell: DRM isolates the effect of status inconsistency from OSS and SSS effects, which is not possible by traditional regression approaches due to collinearity issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We use a unique dataset from Chile&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides objective and subjective social positioning measurements in tandem with cultural participation. We study the Chilean case, looking at whether patterns of consumption in this Latin American country resembles patterns in other societies, where cultural omnivorousness stands out as one of the most prominent characteristics (e.g., Chan &amp;amp; Turner, 2017; Peterson &amp;amp; Kern, 1996). Besides expanding the cultural consumption literature toward developing and Latin American countries, the Chilean case&amp;rsquo;s theoretical relevance lies in its higher level of inequality that dominates the access to culture. As shown by Torche (2010), in Chile, cultural participation is much stratified than in other countries such as France, Britain, and The Netherlands. It could be explained because the high economic barriers to cultural access in Chile. Chile is one of the countries with the highest proportion, and much higher than other countries where cultural omnivore has been intensively studied. Thus, &lt;strong&gt;this case study discusses how cultural omnivore manifests itself in highly unequal contexts with high economic barriers to cultural participation and how objective and subjective status are combined to explain it&lt;/strong&gt;. A more detailed account of the Chilean case is provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Meritocratic Narratives as Cultural Orientations</title>
      <link>/project/children/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The meritocratic principle (Young 1958), which emphasizes the central role of ability and effort for status attainment is losing effectiveness as a collective myth (Lamont 2019). Sociologists argue that meritocratic beliefs, or the narratives that abilities and hard work lead to success, are unfulfilled promises (e.g. Mijs 2016a), as success is not ensured for everyone and societies vary in the strength of the link between education and success in life. The idea that these subjective propositions about the distribution of rewards are legitimations of action and structural conditions for certain groups is becoming common among social scientists (Khan 2011; Mijs 2016a, 2019). Furthermore, the degree to which meritocratic beliefs are accepted and perceived as valid principles of distribution differs between social groups. Privileged families may prefer the meritocratic principle to a larger extent and encourage learning activities (Lareau 2011). According to the findings of Becker and Hadjar (2013), lower social classes (e.g. working classes, lower middle class) are more likely to perceive that success still depends on social origin, social position and family than the upper service class. Specifically, parents affected by negative status-inconsistency, i.e. who have acquired a status below that they would most likely have achieved in light of their educational level, may be assumed to have lost faith in the meritocratic principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to the best of our knowledge, there not evidence of the role of meritocratic beliefs on social reproduction practices. Substantial efforts have been made to explain the early life course mechanisms of social reproductions since Lareau’s (2011) Concerted Cultivation Theory. Middle- and low-class parents differ in their cultural logic of child-rearing. Middle-class parents engage in children’s life experiences in a way that better equip them for adulthood. Organised extra-curricular activities, language use and relation with institutions are at the core of their parenting style. Critically reflecting on this theory, researchers have pointed out this differential is explained by class differences in material resources, and not by cultural logics (Chin and Phillips 2004; Bennett, Lutz, and Jayaram 2012). However, any conclusion related to this debate would be vulnerable without specific measurements of cultural beliefs. &lt;strong&gt;Our research stands out since we include meritocratic belief representing certain aspect of cultural orientation in as the bridge between structural position and child-rearing practice&lt;/strong&gt;. A robust test of meritocratic worldviews as cultural orientations is the main contribution of this study to theory development. The analysis uses data from the China Educational Panel Survey, the first large-scale school-based longitudinal survey conducted in China. To our knowledge, &lt;strong&gt;it is the first quantitative study testing concerted cultivation hypotheses addressing endogeneity issues&lt;/strong&gt;. The empirical strategy combines inverse-probability weighting (IPW) to estimate the causal effect of meritocratic beliefs on concerted cultivation and a two-stage regression model to assess the heterogeneity of this effect across social classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While cultural orientations and their roles in social stratification, educational decisions or parenting styles are widely studied in Western industrialized societies, the role of meritocratic principles in other parts of the world beyond Europe and the US is still under-researched. If meritocratic beliefs legitimize social advantages, they may also affect actions intended to reproduce those advantages as cultural orientations. Weininger, Lareau and Conley (2015) showed that, in the United States, concerted cultivation is not only explained by parents’ objective resources, but also by parents’ cultural orientations. Parenting is a reflection of the parents’ own worldviews and cultural orientations (Bodovski 2010; England and Srivastava 2013). &lt;strong&gt;In this study, we aim to determine whether parents’ meritocratic beliefs affect their parenting style with regard to children’s education and learning.&lt;/strong&gt; We test whether beliefs about hard work and abilities as predictors of scholastic success explain practices of concerted cultivation in China and how they vary across social classes. Accordingly, this study&amp;rsquo;s central innovative potential of this study is the analysis of meritocratic beliefs and child-rearing practices in China -as an Eastern Asian country- that is believed to be characterised by a low level of intergenerational social reproduction (Xie and Zhang 2019; Zhou and Xie 2019). We contribute to the augmentation of Western theories by applying them in a different context. Although there is no equivalent translation into Mandarin Chinese, Confucian philosophy has promoted longstanding meritocratic principles in Western terms. It bonds educational institutions and exam-based qualifications for highly-valued civil service jobs (Hannum et al. 2019). In addition, and in contrast to developed Western societies, educational success in China is not only seen as an individual achievement but is also associated with family honour (Peng 2019). Thus, &lt;strong&gt;China is an ideal case for testing whether parents’ meritocratic narratives play a role in shaping parenting styles in an Eastern Asian society&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is a trend toward increasing social fluidity throughout the world (Ganzeboom, Treiman, and Ultee 1991; Breen 2010), family socioeconomic status remains a fundamental driver of status attainment. Evidence suggests that societies are not beyond class (Becker and Hadjar 2013), but – depending on societal aspects such as the education system – the meritocratic triad of class of origin, education and class of destination is still a valid concept (Hadjar and Becker 2016). However, the mechanisms through which parents transmit advantage from generation to generation is still a subject for debate (e.g. Roksa and Potter 2011; Carolan 2016). For instance, several studies have discussed whether material or non-material family resources affect children’s educational success (Liu and Xie 2015; Mayer 1997). Family income could be directly invested in more and better education, but non-material resources, such as cognitive skills and culture, also explain how parents’ advantages are transferred to their children. Among these factors, parenting styles have been shown to affect children’s short- and long-term outcomes (Chan and Koo 2011; Pong, Hao, and Gardner 2005; Astone and McLanahan 1991).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ageism under the COVID-19 pandemic and its cross-cultural variations</title>
      <link>/project/aging/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/project/aging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by the Interdisciplinary Research Seed Funding of the Faculty of Social Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Aims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has made beliefs and attitudes toward older adults a central element of public discourse. In this context, this project is a timely initiative to understand the formation and evolution of aging stereotypes from a cross-cultural perspective. A long body of literature has discussed that agentic and communal
values are crucial factors shaping aging stereotypes. Nevertheless, few studies have simultaneously used large scale cross-national data, and data collected outside of the laboratory, in examining this issue. This project uses novel computational methods, by combining automated text analysis of Twitter messages (study 1) and online factorial experiments (study 2), to examine the public discourse about older adults and &amp;ldquo;open the black box&amp;rdquo; of aging stereotypes. In study 1, we observe the evolution of agentic and communal content in Twitter messages across time and context. In study 2, we use crowdsourcing platforms to conduct online experiments in China and the United States. They seek to identify and untangle the elements contributing to the formation of stereotypes, and how individual-level agentic and communal values influence the consideration of these elements in the stereotype formation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance to Interdisciplinary Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project contributes to interdisciplinary research because it combines two research tools from computational social sciences (automated text analysis and an online factorial survey using crowdsourcing platforms) to answer two research questions: 1) How aging stereotypes develop in twitter before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and how these aging beliefs are shaped by cultural contexts (i.e. individualism vs. collectivism) through personal values (agency vs. communion)? 2) What sources contribute to the formation of aging stereotypes and how they are related to cultural values (individualism vs. collectivism) and personal values (agency vs. communion)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 1 will use data from Twitter to examine associations between valence of aging stereotypes (warmth vs. competence), cultures (individualism vs. collectivism), and values (agentic vs. communal) based on unsupervised and supervised models. On one hand, with former method, we analyze the text to identify the latent structure of textual corpora, which is a method increasingly used in cultural sociology. On the other hand, the study of emotions and values in psychology have mainly relied on supervised models based on machine learning. We combine both traditions for a more comprehensive understanding of the text. Moreover, study 1 has an interdisciplinary theoretical contribution to examine the complexity of aging views, considering its sociological and psychological underpinnings. From a theoretical perspective, the discourses contained in the texts are aggregated to understand beliefs about older adults in what cultural sociologists have framed as public culture. By tracking public discourse, we examine how a moral shock (COVID-19 pandemic) could have affected shared beliefs about a vulnerable population. Thus, we directly speak to the literature that considers cultural change as a mainly local phenomenon and driven by cohort replacement. Our study will contribute to a more nuanced and balanced view of possibilities for cultural change. In addition, public disclosures of beliefs towards older adults during the pandemic can be explained from the perspective of psychology. Specifically, individuals&amp;rsquo; beliefs toward outgroups can be assessed in terms of the warmth and competence aspects according to the stereotype content model (Fiske et al., 2002). Since older age groups are regarded as high in warmth but low in competence than younger age groups (Cuddy &amp;amp; Fiske, 2002), we can identify changes of ageism on Twitter across time and contexts. Moreover, we will assess how cultural values (individualism vs. collectivism) and personal values (agency vs. communion) impact contents of aging stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study 2 relies on psychological and sociological rationales to &amp;ldquo;open the black box&amp;rdquo; of aging stereotypes. We will further examine how different domains of life in old age lead to subjective social status, a common variable used in stratification beliefs, which is entailed by stereotypes. In study 2, targeting on participants from two cultures
(individualism in the United States and collectivism in China), we will use an online factorial survey to experimentally manipulate cultural, social, economic, and physical elements and estimate their contributions to aging stereotypes formation, and how this process varies across individuals when considering agentic/communal values. With this study, the association between individual values and aging stereotype is examined through the lens of social psychology; moreover, cultural sociology provides insights to understand how beliefs about certain groups are formed and shaped by cultural values as rule-alike-structures. Using a factorial survey approach, we aim to provide further evidence in understanding how different elements suggested by study 1 are combined to
explain stereotypes toward older people. In addition, we also move forward the literatures by incorporating the agentic and communal individual values into the understanding of how older age groups are represented in the social media discourse in times of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cultural Capital and Students Beliefs about Instructional Quality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two main perspectives for understanding teaching effects in the sociological theory. First, the additive perspective understands teaching resources as additives, where instruction is a technological process that leads to achievement. Second, the interactive model proposes that instruction does not produce achievement per se. Instead, opportunities for learning interact with the effects of student characteristics. One of the possible ways in which quality and quantity of instruction could interact with students’ endowments is how they understand opportunities for learning, beliefs that may not be equally distributed across social classes. In this context, &lt;strong&gt;this study aims to understand students’ attributional beliefs about the quality of instruction, and how they interact with the cultural capital of students&lt;/strong&gt;. By using a unique factorial survey, we identified causal attributional beliefs of instruction quality for a representative sample of Chilean primary school students. The findings indicate that students strongly believe that planning time and multidisciplinary team of professional affect teaching quality. Weak beliefs about class size and teachers&amp;rsquo; income satisfaction are found. In addition, the causal attribution of planning time increases with different measurements of students’ cultural capital. Results are discussed considering the contribution of cognitive sociology for studying heterogeneity of teaching effects.&lt;/p&gt;
